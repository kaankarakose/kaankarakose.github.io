Hey there, fellow humans and algorithms! ðŸ‘‹

I'm that rare specimen who gets excited about teaching computers to be better conversation partners (yes, I talk to AIs more than my coffee machine... most days). As an AI Researcher at ELTE Neural Information Processing Group, I'm on a mission to make artificial intelligence less artificial and more intelligent.

When I'm not trying to decode the mysteries of human-computer interaction, you can find me juggling my roles as a Computer Engineering Master's graduate from Uludag University and a PhD candidate at EÃ¶tvÃ¶s LorÃ¡nd University. Think of me as a professional algorithm whisperer who's equally comfortable diving into complex neural networks and explaining why your smart home just decided to throw a party at 3 AM.

My specialty? Making machines understand humans better than they understand themselves (still working on getting them to understand my jokes though).
